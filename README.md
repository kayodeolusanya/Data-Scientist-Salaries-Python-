# Data-Scientist-Salaries-Python-
Data science jobs are some of the fastest-growing, most
in-demand in technology. Since 2012, Data Scientist roles have
increased by 650 percent, and this rise shows no sign of
stopping. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that the
demand for data science skills will increase another 27.9
percent by 2026. And, according to a report from McKinsey,
that spells a shortage of between 140,000 and 190,000 people
with analytical skills in the U.S. alone—not to mention another
1.5 million managers and analysts who will be required to
understand how data analysis drives decision-making.


Data Scientist salaries have also risen with demand; Data
Scientists can typically expect to make six figures. Demand also
translates into an ability to relocate far more easily—from city
to city, and even internationally.

This project aims to do a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis of the
salaries collected by data and features therein, ranging from Experience level, locationJob type etc.
